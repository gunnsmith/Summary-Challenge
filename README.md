### What I learned

Seeing as this is my first project outside of "tutorial hell", I have learned quite a bit thanks to this extremely small project. Sure, I learned how to use margins to center my main container and dipped my toes into flexbox. But more importantly it taught me how to start thinking like an actual developer. No video tutorial or course instructor to walk me through what to put here and what to put there. I had to use my own problem solving skills and creativity. And when I came across something I couldn't seem to solve on my own, I had to get on google, go check MDN Web Docs, search Stack Overflow for similar questions, etc. Although this is probably too small of a page to be considered a "project" for most, I am greatfull that I attempted and accomplished it.
